NTPAD
=====

NTPAD is a HID (Human Interface Device) driver for Windows 2000/XP which will allow you to use game console controllers (Playstation, N64, Genesis, SNES, NES, Atari, etc.) connected to the computer thru the parallel port. It supports all the connection intefaces from the original Directpad Pro

Original project started in 2001 and was discontinued around 2003. Was a personal challange to convince a friend to move to Windows 2000 and he had a PSX controller adapted. Opensourced in 2014 (when I just found its code in my old computer at my mom's house :-D)
